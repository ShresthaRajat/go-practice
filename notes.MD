Hacks


Naming Conventions:

1. Files are named using snake case ie: `data_structures.go`, or `magical_script_praser.go`
2. Variables/identifiers are named in mixedCaps also known as camelCase ie `age`, `sex`, `dateOfBrith`
3. If the indentifier is needed to be exported and be used on outside package use CamelCase starting with a capital letter ie `Name`, `CountryOfOrigin`
4. Functions/Interfaces are named using Capital starting CamelCase ending with "er" suffix ie: `Writer`, `Reader`, & `HtmlCleanParser`
5. Short variable names (it needs to be short but descriptive) 
6. Unique names with capital letters should not be lowercased ie `productAPI`, `HTTPScontent` etc.
